        "$$\n",
        "where\n",
        "- $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ are vectors.\n",
        "- $a_x$ and $b_x$ are the x-axis component of the vectors.\n",

        "##### **Intuition Behind the Dot Product**\n",
        "You can think of the dot product as a form of directional multiplication:\n",
        "- If two vectors have similar directions, the dot product produces a large value relative to their magnitudes.\n",
        "- If the vectors are very different in direction (e.g., orthogonal to each other), the dot product yields a value close to zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "This concept is reinforced by the second equation showing a direct relationship between the dot product and the angle between two vectors:\n",
        "- When $\\theta = 0^\\circ$ (aligned vectors), $\\cos(\\theta) = 1$, resulting in a large positive dot product.\n",
        "- When $\\theta = 90^\\circ$ (orthogonal vectors), $\\cos(\\theta) = 0$, and the dot product is zero.\n",
        "- When $\\theta = 180^\\circ$ (opposite directions), $\\cos(\\theta) = -1$, leading to a large negative dot product.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dot product is the basis to one of the most popular similarity metrics in Machine Learning; the **Cosine Similarity** computed by normalizing the dot product with the magnitudes of the vectors.\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{Cosine Similarity} = \\frac{\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}}{||\\mathbf{a}|| ||\\mathbf{b}||}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "This removes the influence of vector lengths and focuses solely on the direction, making it a useful metric in many applications:\n",
        "- Text similarity: Comparing document embeddings.\n",
        "- Feature matching: Identifying similar patterns in high-dimensional data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This concept extends naturally to matrices, which can be seen as collections of vectors. Thus, the dot product can be applied to measure similarities in more complex structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Key Takeaway**\n",
        "The dot product is a quick and efficient similarity measure:\n",
        "- **Larger dot product values** (relative to the magnitudes of the original vectors) indicate greater similarity.\n",
        "- **Smaller dot product values** suggest dissimilarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Task**\n",
        "Use the dot product to determine which samples in ```X``` are more relevant or similar to the model parameters ```w```. Note that your are not using the Cosine Similarity metric.\n",

        "In order for Gradient Descent to work you must choose the learning rate wisely $\\left(\\alpha \\in (0,1)\\right)$. The learning rate $\\alpha$ determines how rapidly we update the parameters. If the learning rate is too large we may \"overshoot\" the optimal value. Similarly, if it is too small we will need too many iterations to converge to the best values. That's why it is crucial to use a well-tuned learning rate.\n",
